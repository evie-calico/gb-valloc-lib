SECTION "Memory Copy", ROM0

; Copies a certain amount of bytes from one location to another. Destination and
; source are both offset by length, in case you want to copy to or from multiple
; places.
; @ bc: length
; @ de: source
; @ hl: destination
MemCopy::
    dec bc
    inc b
    inc c
.loop:
    ld a, [de]
    ld [hli], a
    inc de
    dec c
    jr nz, .loop
    dec b
    jr nz, .loop
    ret

SECTION "Memory Set", ROM0

; Overwrites a certain amount of bytes with a single byte. Destination is offset
; by length, in case you want to overwrite with different values.
; @ a:  source (is preserved)
; @ bc: length
; @ hl: destination
MemSet::
